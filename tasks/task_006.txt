# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement error handling and recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to the communication layer between Mac client and Ubuntu server.
# Details:
1. Add network error detection and retry logic
2. Implement timeout handling for API requests
3. Create fallback mechanisms for server unavailability
4. Add logging for error diagnosis
5. Implement graceful degradation when components fail
6. Add notification system for persistent errors
7. Create recovery procedures for common failure scenarios

# Test Strategy:
Simulate various failure conditions (network outages, server unavailability, API errors) and verify the system handles them gracefully. Test retry logic and recovery procedures.
